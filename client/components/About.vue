          <P>The goal of this project was to create a website. We had the choice of the subject so we decided to make a music themed website. 
              Music was a great choice as all three of us are musicians. In order to do the website, we used Github to share our code whenever we did a modification.
              We did this website in one and a half week.
          </P>

              <p>3nd year IT student at Efrei Paris, I'm keen on listening to music, playing video games with my friends and programming funny stuff. 
                  When this project started, I was excited about all the things we could do, maybe too much. I still hope you enjoyed our website! 
                  I contributed in the elaboration of the homepage, the artists page, the reviews page, and I made the sequencer you can find on "Let's rock "!
